# Python 

Incremental programming examples written in Python.

## About

Python is a high-level programming language that has become general purpose. It emphasizes code readability through significant indentation and supports the structured, object-oriented, and functional programming paradigms.

The programs in this repository will use all supported paradigms to help users build on their programming abilities, improve their attention to detail, increase their knowledge base, refine their adaptability over time.

## Software Requirements

The following open-source programming language and subsystems were leveraged to develop the educational examples included in this portion of the seeds:

```
    - Python 3.13.0
    - Pip 24.2.0
```

## Principles 

The examples included in this repository will systematically educate users on the following programming principles:

```
    - Program Structure
    - Documentation
    - Packages / Imports
    - Functions
    - Naming Conventions
    - Variables
    - Scoping
    - Looping
    - Conditions
    - Error Handling
    - Abstraction
    - Encapsulation
    - Inheritance
    - Execution
    - Input / Output
    - Parallelism 
```

## Data Types

This section will discuss the different data types provided by this programming language. They are leveraged to create the examples and will be necessary to progress further.

### Numeric Types
These are intergers, floating points, or complex numbers. Each numeric type is accompanied by their own set of operations but are used to represent some quantity. Intergers (int) are plain numbers without a decimal point whereas floating points (float) are plain numbers with values after a decimal. Complex numbers (comlex) are imaginary numbers or numbers that contain the square root of negative one.

Here are some examples:

Type | Value | Description
---|---|---
int | 1 | Plain number with no decimal point
float | 1.0 | Plain number with some value(s) after the decimal point
complex | 1j | Plain number and **j** representing $\sqrt{-1}$

### Boolean Type
These represent truth values and can only represent instances of **True** or **False**. The Boolean type **bool** can also behave like numeric types where zero is False and any nonzero value is True. 

Here are some examples:

Type | Value | Description
---|---|---
bool | False | A characteristic between of two dissimilar variables
bool | True | The logical calculus of set membership 
bool | True | The complex number 1j or $\sqrt{-1}$
bool | False | The interger 0

### Bitwise Types
### Iterator Types
### Sequence Types
### Text Sequence Type
### Binary Sequence Types
### Set Types
### Mapping Types
### Type Annotation Types

## Operators

This section will discuss the different operators provided by this programming language. They are leveraged to create the examples and will be necessary to progress further.

### Numeric Types
These can be used to manipulate or compare the values of int and float data, not complex data. They are associated with int, float, or bool data types depending on the nature of the mathematical operation/comparison.

Here are some examples:

Operation | Result | Description
---|---|---
1 $+$ 1 | 2 | 1 $+$ 1 $=$ 2
1.0 $-$ 0.5 | 0.5 | 1.0 $-$ 0.5 $=$ 0.5
1 $*$ 2.5 | 2.5 | 1 $*$ 025 $=$ 2.5
2 $**$ 2.0| 4.0 | 2^2.0 $=$ 4.0
$\sqrt{-1}$ $/$ $\sqrt{-1}$ | 1 + 0j| $\sqrt{-1}$ $/$ $\sqrt{-1}$ $=$ 1 

### Boolean Type
These can be used to test truth value of statements. They are used within *if* or *while* conditions and typically define set membership or a relationship between two variables. 

Var | Operation | Result | Description
---|---|---|---
c = 4 | if c is (5 or 6)  | False | Applies comparison of some variable, c, to other variables in a condition  
c = 'o' | if c in ('ok and 'no') | True | Applies existence of some variable, c, in other expressions to a condition 
c = True | if not c | True | Applies truth of some statement, c, to a condition
